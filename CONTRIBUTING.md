## What You Cannot Modify

**Important Note!**

This repository was created to showcase the code found inside the `pages` directory. The files and code within that directory should **not** be modified by anyone other than the repository owner, me ([@MFM-347](https://codepen.io/MFM-347)).

### Restricted Directory:

- `pages/`

This means no changes to any files in `pages/` are allowed in your contributions. Feel free to explore, but please respect the integrity of this section.

---

## What You Can Contribute

Here’s where **you** come in.

You are free to modify or add any code **outside** the `pages/` directory, such as:

- Enhancements or refactoring to styles or scripts located in other directories.
- Adding new features that don’t interfere with the `pages/` directory content.
- Improving documentation (like this one).
- Bug fixes, optimizations, or general improvements.

Your contributions should make the project better while keeping the integrity of the showcased code inside the `pages/` directory intact.

## How to Submit Changes

Once you've made your changes:

1. **Commit your changes**: Write meaningful commit messages that clearly describe what you've changed.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   ```
2. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin dev
   ```
3. **Create a Pull Request**: Head over to the original repository on GitHub and submit a Pull Request (PR). Make sure to:
   - Provide a detailed description of what your changes are and why they're necessary.
   - Reference any related issues or features.
